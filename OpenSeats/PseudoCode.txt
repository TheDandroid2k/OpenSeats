Python Script to check open seats for classes

User GUI
-User enters Term and CRN of course (add if statement for typos "Not a class!")
	-If class is closed they can checkbox to get e-mail when it opens
	(Will need a seperate script constantly running to check this)
		-User enters e-mail
			-E-mail goes into CSV file (e-mail,term,CRN)
			-Add check to see if the user has already requested that class

Seperate script to constantly check seat availability
-Loop to check every 30 mins/1 hour
	-If 'Act' is > 0
		-send e-mail (but only once)
