Python Script to check open seats for classes

User GUI
-User enters Term and CRN of course (add if statement for typos "Not a class!")
	-If class is closed they can checkbox to get e-mail when it opens
	(Will need a seperate script constantly running to check this)
		-User enters e-mail
			-E-mail goes into CSV file (e-mail,term,CRN)
			-Add check to see if the user has already requested that class

Seperate script to constantly check seat availability
-Loop to check every 30 mins/1 hour
	-If 'Act' is > 0
		-send e-mail (but only once)

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------
E-mail Method
-User e-mails openseat1909@gmail.com
	-Subject must be in specific format: term [space] crn. Ex: 202020 20520
	-E-mail reply confirming term & crn
	>>What about wrong term & crn?

-Script constantly running to look for new e-mails
	-if subject starts with 201980, 202020, 202040
	-then add e-mail, term, and crn to csv file (change to database?)
-Another script constantly running to check for open seats 
	-if Rem > 0, then e-mail users
	-Remove users from csv

-Run all this using Portable VirtualBox/Linux server??
